### welcome to olive
Olive.jl is a customizable Integrated Development Environment for Julia programming in a notebook-like environment. Executable blocks of code are surrounded by Markdown in a far more reproducible form than ever before. Olive features
- Extensibility
- Deployability
- Customization
- Interactive capabilities
- Toolips bonuses -- there will be more of these as time goes on

The goal with Olive is to replace the conventional IDE with a mutable IDE -- allowing creators to create however they like to create with the flexibility of custom cells and extensions!

##### tech stack
Olive is fueled by a web of other Chifi projects. Olives.jl is [Toolips](https://github.com/ChifiSource#Toolips)-based. Thus, many dependencies are Toolips extensions, here is a look at that list:
- [Toolips]()
- [ToolipsSession](https://github.com/ChifiSource/ToolipsSession.jl)
- [ToolipsMarkdown](https://github.com/ChifiSource/ToolipsMarkdown.jl)
- [ToolipsDefaults](https://github.com/ChifiSource/ToolipsDefaults.jl)
- [ToolipsBase64](https://github.com/ChifiSource/ToolipsBase64.jl)
- [ToolipsAuth](https://github.com/ChifiSource/ToolipsAuth.jl)

And there is one package that is used from [odd data](https://github.com/ChifiSource#odddata).
- [IPy](https://github.com/ChifiSource/IPy.jl)
